Progress Bar Solution Notes

1. Overall - I really enjoyed this exercise! I work in Vue Js all day so this
was a great React refresher.

2. V1 - It's great there wasn't a strict deadline because v1 took me through two
refactors (as seen in v1 commit history)! I started by overthinking the problem
and wanting progress control at an interval but soon realized the benefits of
using simple CSS transitions/animations.

3. V2 - WIP

3. Improvements - TBD

4. Testing - TBD
