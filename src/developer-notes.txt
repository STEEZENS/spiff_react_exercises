Progress Bar Solution Notes

1. Overall - I really enjoyed this exercise! I work in Vue Js all day so this
was a great React refresher.

2. V1 - It's great there wasn't a strict deadline because v1 took me two
refactors (as seen in v1 commit history)! I started by overthinking the problem
and wanting progress control at an interval but soon realized the benefits of
using simple CSS transitions/animations.

3. V2 - I had to pick my brain for a good minute choosing a simple/best solution
for the breakpoint requirement. I instinctively wanted to use requestAnimationFrame
or setInterval and compute a delta between the current progress and current
breakpoint on each poll. But I finally realized a simple animation map could be
passed to a timeout which not only makes things easier to reason about, but also
better for performance.

3. Improvements - A major improvement would be type safety. A few of my functions
and props don't validate their parameters/values which may be fine for this exercise,
but in a production environment Typescript would be a great improvement.
In v2, a small detail that could be improved is the timing function. The progress
comes to a slight stop at each breakpoint. I'd like it to be a bit more fluid.

4. Testing - Honestly, I feel like I went well over the allotted time for this
exercise and for the sake of submitting my work never got to testing (so the
story goes with testing...)
